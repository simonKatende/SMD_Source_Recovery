# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repo is

This is a **source-recovery project**, not a greenfield codebase. The original C# source for the Alien Age School Management Dynamics desktop application was lost; what lives here was reconstructed by decompiling the installed binaries with `ilspycmd`. Treat the code as recovered artifact — names, layout, and oddities reflect what the decompiler emitted, not deliberate design choices.

Recovery completed 2026-05-24. 21 assemblies (~819 source files, ~77 MB) were decompiled. The 4 entry-point EXEs (`IXtreme`, `LibraryManagement`, `MarksEntry`, `ExtremeMessenger`) rebuild from source at 99.8%+ size match with the originals; the 17 library projects are decompiled but not yet rebuilt — the EXEs link against the original DLLs in `backup/` via `HintPath`.

## Repository layout

| Folder | In git? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `decompiled/` | yes | One project per original assembly (21 total). Build inputs live here. |
| `notes/` | yes | Reproduction scripts (`decompile_all.ps1`, `gen_interop.ps1`) + per-build logs. |
| `backup/` | **no** | Frozen mirror of `C:\Program Files (x86)\Alien Age\School Management Dynamics\`. All `.csproj` files reference it via `HintPath="..\..\backup\<dll>"`. Must be recreated locally before any build. |
| `smoke_test/` | no | Runtime deployment used to validate that a rebuilt EXE launches. Mirror of `backup/` plus the freshly-built EXE and its `.exe.config`. |
| `reconstructed/` | yes (empty) | Reserved for a future unified `.sln`. |

## Setting up a fresh machine

```powershell
# 1. Recreate backup/ from the installed app
robocopy "C:\Program Files (x86)\Alien Age\School Management Dynamics" `
         "<repo>\backup" /E /COPY:DAT

# 2. Generate the ZK fingerprint COM interop (must run under Windows PowerShell 5.1,
#    not pwsh — it needs the full .NET Framework's TypeLibConverter)
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File notes\gen_interop.ps1

# 3. .NET 8 SDK (used to invoke the net472-targeted build)
winget install Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.8
```

## Build

```powershell
dotnet build decompiled\IXtreme\IXtreme.csproj
dotnet build decompiled\LibraryManagement\LibraryManagement.csproj
dotnet build decompiled\MarksEntry\MarksEntry.csproj
dotnet build decompiled\ExtremeMessenger\ExtremeMessenger.csproj
```

Output lands in each project's `bin\Debug\net472\`. There is **no test suite**; verification is "does the EXE launch and render its first form" via the `smoke_test/` deployment.

## Project shape

- SDK: `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.WindowsDesktop` (WinForms).
- Target: `net472`, `PlatformTarget=x86`, `LangVersion=11.0`, `AllowUnsafeBlocks=true`.
- Every entry-point csproj sets `<GenerateResourceUsePreserializedResources>true</GenerateResourceUsePreserializedResources>` and `PackageReference Include="System.Resources.Extensions"` — required because the decompiled `.resx` files contain binary-formatted resources. The matching `IXtreme.exe.config` adds a binding redirect so the runtime resolves `System.Resources.Extensions 8.0.0`.
- UI framework is DevExpress v23.2 (XtraBars/XtraGrid/XtraReports/XtraCharts/etc.). Sister libraries live under the `AlienAge.*` namespace.
- Fingerprint hardware via the ZK biometric SDK (`Interop.zkemkeeper.dll`, generated from a registered TypeLib — not redistributable, hence `gen_interop.ps1`).
- COM interops (`Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel`, `office`, `Interop.zkemkeeper`) are referenced with `EmbedInteropTypes=True`. Do not check in the decompiled `Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel/` folder — reference the real PIA instead.

## Working with decompiled code — recurring fixes

The decompiler emits valid-looking C# that doesn't quite compile. These are the patterns that have come up in `IXtreme`, `LibraryManagement`, `MarksEntry`, `ExtremeMessenger`. Expect the same classes of issue in the 17 library projects when they're eventually built.

1. **`ref array[0]` should be `out array[0]`** — for `SSR_GetUserTmp` callsites (seen in `MainForm.cs`, `usrStudentList.cs`).
2. **Phantom overload** — `FeesBalance(StudentNo, connectionString)` doesn't exist; drop the second arg (seen in `SynchPaymentsFromOnline.cs`).
3. **Unassigned locals in `finally`** — `int num;` in an unused `finally` block compiles in IL but not in C#; initialize to `0`.
4. **`DataTable` ambiguity** — collides between `System.Data.DataTable` and `Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.DataTable`. Add `using DataTable = System.Data.DataTable;` to the affected file (`StudentImport.cs`, `EmployeeImport.cs`, `BooksImport.cs`, `MainALevel.cs`, `MainPrimary.cs`, `MainOLevelNewCur.cs`).
5. **`Point` ambiguity** — same problem between `System.Drawing.Point` and `Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Point`. Add `using Point = System.Drawing.Point;`.
6. **CS0136 scope conflicts** — inner-scope variable shadows an enclosing-scope variable with the same name. The decompiler doesn't notice; rename one (e.g. `SqlCommand sqlCommand` → `SqlCommand cmd` in `MarksEntry/MainALevel.cs`).
7. **Missing transitive DevExpress references** — the decompiler lists only directly-used assemblies. When the compiler complains about an unresolved type from a DevExpress namespace, add an explicit `<Reference>` to the relevant `DevExpress.*.v23.2.dll` in `backup/`. Already added across the four EXEs: `DevExpress.Charts.v23.2.Core`, `DevExpress.Printing.v23.2.Core`, `DevExpress.Data.Desktop.v23.2`, `DevExpress.Drawing.v23.2`.

**Rule of thumb when fixing decompiler artifacts:** preserve byte-for-byte behavior. The goal is "rebuilt EXE matches original size to within ~0.2%," not refactoring. Don't tidy up odd identifier names, don't collapse generated `dSet*`/`HelperDS` DataSet partials, don't reorganize files.

## Conventions to respect

- **Don't commit `backup/` or `smoke_test/`** — both are gitignored. They contain third-party DLLs (DevExpress, ZK SDK, etc.) that are not ours to redistribute.
- **Build logs go to `notes/`** — never let `*.binlog` or scratch log files land in project folders. The convention is `notes\<Project>_buildN.log`.
- **Per-project, not per-solution** — there is no `.sln`. Build each `.csproj` directly with `dotnet build`. If a solution is later assembled, it goes in `reconstructed/`.
- **Recovery details belong in commit messages.** When you fix a new class of decompiler artifact, document the pattern in the commit message (filename, line, before → after) so the README and this file can be updated from `git log`.

## Fees Follow-up Glossary

Shared vocabulary for developing the Fees Follow-up CRM feature. When either of us uses these terms, these definitions apply.

### Guardian & Family

**Guardian** — the parent or contact person responsible for paying fees for one or more students. The unit of communication in the follow-up process — you contact a guardian, not individual students.

**Guardian Key** — the unique identifier for a guardian family. Derived from the student record: `PriorityContact` phone → `OtherContact` phone → `"NOCONTACT-{StudentNumber}"` when both are blank. Stored in `tbl_FeesContactLog.GuardianKey`.

**Guardian Label** — the display string shown in the worklist, e.g. `"0771234567 (Mother)"`. Combines the phone number with the guardian relationship field.

**Guardian Family** — all students that share the same Guardian Key. One row per family in the worklist, not one row per student.

**Priority Contact** — the primary phone number on the student record (`tbl_Stud.PriorityContact`). Used first when deriving the Guardian Key.

**Other Contact** — the secondary phone number (`tbl_Stud.OtherContact`). Fallback when Priority Contact is blank.

### Worklist

**Worklist** — the grid on the Fees Follow-up page. One row per guardian family with an outstanding balance, sorted by Priority Tier (Critical first). Backed by `List<GuardianWorklistRow>`.

**Guardian Worklist Row** — a single worklist row. Holds aggregated financials, priority tier, and last contact info for one guardian family. Backed by `GuardianWorklistRow`.

**Student Summary** — per-student breakdown inside a guardian family row. Shown in the interaction dialog. Holds individual Balance, TotalBilled, TotalPaid, and PaymentPercent. Backed by `StudentSummary`.

### Financial

**Billed** — total fees charged for the term. What the school expects to collect.

**Paid** — total payments received for the term.

**Balance** — outstanding amount still owed: `Billed − Paid`. When we say "balance" we mean what's still owed, not what was charged.

**Payment Percent** — `Paid / Billed × 100`. How much of the billed amount has been settled (e.g. 40%).

### Pacing

**Pacing Gap** — `(TermElapsedDays / TermTotalDays) − (TotalPaid / TotalBilled)`. Positive = guardian is behind pace. Zero when term dates are not configured.

**Term Elapsed Days** — days since Term Start Date as of today.

**Term Total Days** — total days in the term: `TermEndDate − TermStartDate`.

### Priority Tiers

Sorted ascending — lower number = higher urgency.

**Critical (0)** — Pacing Gap ≥ Critical Threshold. Guardian is significantly behind payment pace relative to term progress. Shown in red.

**Broken Promise (1)** — guardian made a promise but Promise Date passed and Payments Since Promise did not cover the Promise Amount. Displayed in UI as "Missed Promise". Shown in coral.

**Stale (2)** — no contact logged within the Stale Threshold. Displayed in UI as "Contact Overdue". Shown in yellow.

**Current (3)** — none of the above apply. Displayed in UI as "Up to Date".

### Contact & Interaction

**Contact Log** — a single logged interaction with a guardian. Records date, channel, outcome, note, and optional promise. Stored in `tbl_FeesContactLog`. Backed by `FeesContactLog`.

**Contact Channel** — how the contact was made: `Phone`, `SMS`, or `InPerson`.

**Contact Outcome** — result of a contact attempt: `Contacted`, `NoAnswer`, `ContactUnavailable` (out of coverage), `ContactOff` (phone off), `Promised` (committed to pay), `Refused`.

**Promise Date** — date the guardian committed to paying by. Required when Outcome = `Promised`.

**Promise Amount** — amount the guardian committed to paying. Optional alongside Promise Date.

**Payments Since Promise** — sum of payments received after the latest Promise Date. Used to evaluate whether a promise was honoured.

### Settings

**Stale Threshold** — days since last contact before a row becomes Stale. Default: 7.

**Term Start / Term End** — boundaries of the current academic term. Required for the Required-Payment Line and the Critical tier. When not set, deadline-based prioritisation is off: shortfall is 0, the Critical tier cannot trigger, and the worklists/dashboard show a warning banner.

**Collection Goal** — the term-end collection target driving the Required-Payment Line. Stored as a fraction (0–1), shown as a percentage. Default 0.98 (98%).

**Required-Payment Line** — `CollectionGoal × TermProgress × 100`. The payment percent a guardian is expected to have reached today. Replaces the old flat First/Second-Half phase targets, ramping from ~0% at term start to the goal at term end.

**Shortfall** — `RequiredPct − PaymentPercent`, in percentage points. Positive = behind the line.

**Critical Shortfall Points** — shortfall (pts) at or above which a guardian with no active promise becomes Critical. Default 25. Sole Critical driver alongside the retained no-progress escalation; replaces the pacing-gap and flat-phase Critical rules.

**Urgency Score** — `TotalBalance × (1 + max(0,Shortfall)/50) × behaviour`, where behaviour multiplies by 1.5 (broken promise), 1.3 (failed last outcome), 1.4 (recent Call Required), and 0.4 (covering active promise). The single sort key for every worklist (guardian, daily, student); the priority tier now drives only row colour and dashboard grouping, not ordering. Lives in the pure, unit-tested `FeesUrgency` static class (`I_Xtreme.ExtremeClasses`).

**Call Required Window Days** — only an Overdue SMS sent within this many days flags Call Required; the flag then feeds the Urgency Score (×1.4) rather than pinning the row to a top tier. Default 14. Relies on `tbl_SmsReminderLog.SentAt`.

**Promise Resurface Days** — within this many days of term end, partially-covered promises are no longer hidden from the daily list, so the uncovered remainder gets worked before the deadline. Default 14.

**General Reminder Cooldown Days** — minimum days between balance reminders to the same
guardian, so running "Send Balance Reminders" daily texts each at-risk guardian at most once
per window. Default 7. Logged as `ReminderType = 'General'` in `tbl_SmsReminderLog`
(cooldown measured against `SentAt`).

**Balance Reminder** — an SMS to an at-risk guardian (tier Critical or Broken Promise, owing,
no active promise) who has *not* made a promise. Separate "Send Balance Reminders" ribbon
action; renders `SmsTemplateGeneral` (falls back to the built-in general template). Distinct
from promise reminders (3-day / day-of / overdue), which are anchored to a promise date.

**Reminder consolidation** — promise reminders are sent one SMS per guardian per
reminder-type occurrence (e.g. three children all "due today" → one message with the family
total), while per-student de-dup logging is preserved.

**Critical Threshold (`CriticalPacingGapThreshold`)** — retired from tier logic in the 2026-06-08 overhaul. The model field and its `tbl_FollowUpSettings` persistence remain (dormant) for backward compatibility; it no longer affects prioritisation and the settings dialog no longer exposes it. `PacingGap` is still computed and shown in the grid.

**Threshold units — read before adding a new one.** Settings thresholds in `FeesFollowUpSettings` mix conventions. `CollectionGoal` (and the dormant `CriticalPacingGapThreshold`) are **fractions (0–1)**. `CriticalShortfallPoints` and `NoProgressPaymentThreshold` are **percentage points (0–100)**, compared against `Shortfall`/`PaymentPercent` (also 0–100). `CallRequiredWindowDays` and `PromiseResurfaceDays` are **day counts**. When adding a threshold, match the unit of the value it is compared against; the settings dialog stores percent-convention values as whole numbers (SpinEdit) and fraction-convention values divided by 100 (e.g. Collection Goal shown as 98, saved as 0.98).
